      README file for the `COCO2P' GAP4 package 
     ===========================================

COCO2P is a GAP 4 package for computing with coherent configurations
and, more generally, with arc-colored graphs. It is meant to be a more
modern version of the computer package COCO by Igor Faradzev and
Mikhail Klin, but it does not pretend to superceed it. 

The following persons contributed in various ways in the creation of
COCO2P:
	Mikhail Klin,
	Christian Pech (maintainer),
	Sven Reichard

There exists another branch of development of COCO maintained by Sven
Reichard. Misha Klin suggested to name the two branches COCO2R and
COCO2P, respectively - hence the name of this package is
COCO2P. We hope that eventually the two efforts to modernize COCO will
lead to the creation of a GAP package COCO2.

To get the newest version of COCO2P, download the
archive file
    coco2p-x.x.tar.gz

If you are an administrator on your computer and have access to the
root-directory of gap 4, then copy this file to the subdirectory 'pkg' of the root
directory of gap 4.

If you are not an administrator of your computer, or if you do not
want coco2p to be available to all users of your computer, then go to
the user root directory of gap4. You can find out its location from
inside gap 4 by the following command:
       GAPInfo.UserGapRoot;
Copy the file coco2p-x.x.tar.gz to the subdirector 'pkg' of this
directory (create it if it does not exist).

Now unpack the coco2p archive using 
    gunzip coco2p-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf coco2p-x.x.tar

this will create a subdirectory coco2p. The documentation of coco2p
can now be found in './coco2p/doc/manual.pdf' 
With this the installation of coco2p is finished.

From whithin gap4 you can load coco2p by issuing the command:
     LoadPackage("coco2p");

Help about coco2p can be obtained from inside gap 4 using the command
     ?coco2p
