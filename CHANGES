		  	1) KnownGroupOfColorAutomorphismsOnColors
			2) SetKnownGroupOfColorAutomorphismsOnColorsNC
			3) IsColorIsomorphismOfColorGraphs
colgraph.gi	- added implementation of
		  	1) KnownGroupOfColorAutomorphismsOnColors
			2) SetKnownGroupOfColorAutomorphismsOnColorsNC
			3) IsColorIsomorphismOfColorGraphs
		- cleaned up the code for ColorAutomorphismGroup
		- simplified the code of ColorAutomorphismGroupOnColors
		- fixed the code of ColorIsomorphismColorGraphs
		  that stoped working due to a regression cause by the changes
		  in waut.gi (described below)
		- made the operation ClosedSets available also for inhomogeneous
		  color graphs
fusion.gi	- changed some error-messages
goodsets.gi	- changed some error-messages
		- added some status messages
pbag.gi		- some minor clean up

		  return the empty list. This could lead to errors during the computation
		  of orbits of homogeneous fusions
waut.gi		- improved the implementations of CheckGroup and FindCosRep
		  they take into account now already computed color automorphisms
		  This should lead to a speedup when computing the color automorphism
		  group of a WL-stable color graph 

Changes from version 0.16 to version 0.17

				  the database by Matan Ziv-Av)
tensor.gd    	- Added synonym attribute VertexNamesOfTensor
various files	- fixed a bug with isomorphism test of coco objects
				  it could happen that an isomorphism test between two coco objects would use
				  different invariants for the objects leading to a wrong result.

Changes from version 0.14 to version 0.15
colgraph.gi     - added new method for Adjacency matrix
                - Corrected DirectProductColorGraph
                - added new constructor BIKColorGraph

                  IsIsomorphismOfColorGraphs, IsAutomorphismOfColorGraph,
                  VertexNamesOfColorGraph
tensor.gi       - added Method for \[\] to support the syntax T[i,j,k]

                - created new function TensorFromColorReps that creates a blocked tensor
                  only if the given cgr has more than one fibre; otherwise a more
                  efficient dense tenor is created
                  made coco2p independent from the setorbit package

Changes from version 0.11 to version 0.12
goodsets.gi     - Added ViewObject method for good sets
                - in method SubOrbitsWithInvariantPropertyOfCocoOrbit
                  the test is applied now only to the canonical representatives
                  of suborbits; thus, every given test-function gets made artificially
                  invariant (even if it is not constant on orbits)
                  This fixes a bug in the algorithm for the computation of homogeneous fusions,
                  that used a test function that was not invariant (but expected to be used on
                  canonical representatives
fusion.gi       - fixed a bug where fusion orbits were created with wrong stabilizers
                  this resulted in a wrong size-information



Changes from version 0.1 to version 0.11

colgraphs.g?    - PartitionClosedSet requires a set as input and should require a list
schemesdb.gi    - put the created global variables 'as???' into the
                  namespace of COCO2P and preserve existing global
                  variables (done)
colgraphs.gi    - fixed bug in LiftToColorAutomorphism algebraic
                  automorphisms were added to the color automorphism
                  group (done)
fusion.gi       - implement Method Rank for fusions (done)
character.g?    - make use of the package Singular, if loaded (done)
character.gi    - make use of the package alnuth and Pari/Gp for
                  for computing roots of polynomials (done)
colorsemiring.g? - ColorSemiringElement required a set as second
                  argument, but shoud require a list. (done)
character.gi    - MultiplicitiesOfCharacters assumed that the index of
                  the reflexive color of a scheme is always 1 however,
                  this is not guaranteed. This assumption lead to wrong
                  multiplicity vectors (fixed)
colgraphs.gi    - reimplemented and documented the function
                  CyclotomicColorGraph (done)
colgraphs.g?    - implement and document DirectProductColorGraphs (done)
colgraphs.g?    - implement and document WreathProductColorGraphs (done)
general         - COCO2P now requires grape (but not nauty) at the
                  moment, some important functions like PartitionClosedSet depend
                  on grape. This dependency will be removed in a future
                  version of COCO2P.
